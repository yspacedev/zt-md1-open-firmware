# zt-md1-open-firmware
An open source firmware for the Zoyi ZT-MD1 LCR tweezers + reverse engineered schematic

Currently, the firmware is still in development (though I have code for driving all the pripherals and some basic logic for LCR measurements). The code in firmware-dev is not guaranteed to work.
